In version 1.0, the performance of the app is acceptable. Our app is completely useable and, although we were unable to implement full functionality, we have successfully completed the task of generating a schedule. The accuracy of the app is at 100%; we stayed on-plan and have made very few changes to our original idea. Efficiency so far, is good. As mentioned above, we do not have full functionality so we are unable to say the efficiency of the app is higher than just good due to the inability to generate many schedules at a time; however, we project the efficiency to be acceptable in the future. Furthermore, our app is extremely user-friendly and visually appealing; it sticks to the Human Interface Guidelines laid out by Apple. All of the navigation buttons are clearly labeled to make the experience as easy as possible for the user, along with prompting the user after completing major tasks or functions. We also did our best to minimize the number of interactions the app requires to get a desired result, such as inputting optional information or additional times for classes that are not available at more than one or two times. As far as visual appeal, the app maintains a consistent color scheme as well as pre-defined constraints on all objects to keep everything aligned appropriately for when the app is run on different sized iPhones.

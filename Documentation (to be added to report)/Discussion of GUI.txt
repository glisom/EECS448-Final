Our GUI was designed to be simple and to-the-point. The app flows smoothly from screen to screen with clearly labeled buttons to advance or backtrack. We also have custom art for both the application icon as well as overlays of specific screens to give a tutorial in the help section. As far colors go, we chose to keep a consistent scheme. The app maintains a light blue and white scheme; it is even integrated into the physical schedule as well. Due to size constraints for multiple iOS devices, the times (along the y-axis) were unable to be included in the schedule screen. Additionally, the schedule may only work from the hours of 8am to 6pm. It also may only deal with hour-long classes. These issues are planned to be addressed in future versions.

In conclusion, we have come to find deadlines are incredibly hard to make and learning new coding languages is extremely difficult; however, the overall process was enjoyable. During development, the team ran into many problems such as having only one device to develop on, our original GitHub becoming corrupt, and general time conflicts between team members. In the end, though, we were able to produce a working app with a vast majority of the working functionality we had intended from the beginning. 
In future versions of our app, we hope to include the functionality that we were unable to implement originally. This includes having the scheduler generate more than one schedule, add times to the y-axis of the schedule object, and handle a variety of class lengths. As for features we did not plan for the first version, but would like to add later, there are plenty. For the most part, our additions would be targeted at the schedule object itself. We would like to be able to export saved schedules in a variety of formats such as a PDF, GIF, PNG, JPG, etc. Another addition would be to add more information on the class to be added. For example, optional fields could be the full class name, class code, and a section for a brief description of the class. Other expansions we would like to make include broadening the times in which classes may be schedules as well as adding a share function for friends of the same major to coordinate class times. Although these are all large additions, we believe them to be achievable.
